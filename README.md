# DMRs
DMRs are genomic regions that have consistently different DNA methylation across multiple adjacent CpGs. The DMRs mapped to or near the genes that are enriched for the biological process of the regulation of sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity suggest that these genes are involved in regulation of gene expression.

DMRs were initially identified using the â€˜the Bioconductor DMRcate package and verified using comb-p. These packages are consistently reported to have the best sensitivity and highest control of false positive rate when compared to other DMR tools. A significant DMR can be detected even if there is no genome-wide significant DMP in the region. DMRcate identifies DMRs from the tunable kernel smoothing process of association signals.
